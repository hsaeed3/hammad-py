The hammadpy library is now a very small library, with classes & functions slowly moving to raw compiled rust. Currently some platforms may face a build problem when installing the library, but it should be alright for most cases. Run the following cell block to install the library.

```bash
pip install hammadpy>=3.10.1
```
